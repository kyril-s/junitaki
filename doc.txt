Team Timer Tool – Product Specification
1. Executive Summary
A web-based timer application designed to help UX and design teams manage various types of meetings and sessions efficiently. The tool supports multiple meeting templates, customizable phases, and automatic alerts to keep sessions on track.

2. Problem Statement
Design teams often struggle to keep meetings focused and within time limits, especially during critiques, presentations, and user testing. A dedicated timer with predefined and customizable phases will help teams stay organized, ensure fairness, and improve productivity.

3. Project Objectives
Streamline meeting management for design critiques, presentations, user testing, and custom sessions.

Ensure equal time allocation for each phase of a meeting.

Provide clear, accessible alerts to keep participants informed.

Support both desktop and mobile use for flexibility.

Enable customization for different team needs.

4. Project Scope
In Scope:

Meeting Type Selection: Users can choose from “Critique Meeting,” “Design Presentation,” “Customized Meeting,” and “User Testing Session.”

Predefined Phases and Durations: For each meeting type, phases and default durations are set.

Customizable Phases: Users can add, remove, or adjust phases and durations for “Customized Meeting” and “User Testing Session.”

Timer Features: Start, pause, reset, and automatic progression to the next phase.

Alerts: Audio and visual alerts 30 seconds before each phase ends.

Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and clear visual cues.

Out of Scope:

User authentication and accounts (initially; can be added in later phases).

Persistent data storage (initially; sessions are not saved between uses).

Collaborative editing (multiple users editing the same timer simultaneously).

5. Key Stakeholders
UX Manager: Primary user and advocate.

Product Designers, UX Researchers, Content Designers: End users.

Development Team: Builders of the tool.

IT/Support: For deployment and maintenance.
